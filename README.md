# hello-world
Hello Humans,

I come from year 2100 from this same planet that you still have. We only have 50 people left, the global pollution you started ended up warming the planet and destroying insects, therefore any kind of plants, without plant no food and you don't have to be a nerd to understand what's next.
So they sent me to tell you the future, so you start changing your present today for yourself and you're beloved ones.
